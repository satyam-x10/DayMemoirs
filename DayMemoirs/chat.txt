                        I was walking down the streets of Gujarat when I saw an old Lady selling Khakra and Chips for
                        ‚Çπ10.
                        I suggested ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you also start selling Chai? People would love to have it along with
                        Khakra and you can increase your products and sales!‚Äù
                        Sounded brilliant to me! That‚Äôs what I had learned in my College ‚ÄúEarn money from various
                        sources‚Äù
                        She told me ‚ÄúBhaiya, mere baaju Mei ek Chai wala hai. Agar mai chai bechungi toh wo kya krega?!
                        Uska pura ghar bas Chai ke bharose chalta hai!!
                        (There is a man who sells tea beside me. If I start selling it, what will he sell? His whole
                        family depends on it!)
                        I was dumbstruck!!
                        Today, I learned that it is not a market, where people think: Let me start this business, extend
                        my brand to multiple products and capture a higher market share!
                        These guys know that to Co-exist you need to fulfill everyone‚Äôs needs and not be selfish in
                        filling your stomach. A street entrepreneur knows when it is enough!!
                        This is India, Where Humanity prevails over Profits!

                        I was driving north on the frontage road alongside the Sam Houston Tollway in west Houston in
                        the late afternoon. There was a vehicle in front of me about 7 or 8 car lengths. We were coming
                        up on a traffic light that turned from red to green sufficiently in time for the car in front of
                        me to not have to start braking, or else he had to brake very little. I didn‚Äôt brake at all.

                        Suddenly, a car shot through the intersection from left to right 3 or 4 seconds after the light
                        changed to green for us. The car in front of me didn‚Äôt brake, but I‚Äôm sure he was doing a
                        double-take to make sure we had a green light, because that was what I was doing.
                        About three or four years later, I sort of saw a chain-reaction rear end collision involving
                        about six cars after a car passed me at night on a six-lane highway in far west Houston doing
                        about 75 mph in a 45. About a quarter of a mile up ahead, I saw her tail lights come on. When I
                        got up there, everybody was getting out of their cars at a traffic light. I couldn‚Äôt tell what
                        happened really. All I could really tell was that her brake lights came on.

                        Much more recently, I heard an accident, but I didn‚Äôt see it.

                        All beaches in Sydney (Australia) are all basically topless - if you chose to go that way - and
                        many girls sunbathe in only a bikini bottom.

                        I was at the beach one day and heard a scream.

                        A girl was apparently sunbathing on her back and a baby from another group, had crawled a few
                        feet away from its mother, and latched onto the one thing that it recognised‚Ä¶

                        This is my first surgery as a doctor.

                        So, let me tell you, it's not as cool as it looks. I assisted this laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
                        And I held the laparoscopic camera initially, and I held it stable and was able to maneuver it
                        as told. Later, I had to retract the gall bladder for the consultant to dissect.

                        But 5 min into the operation, I got a stupid itch. And obviously, I couldn't relieve it in this
                        sterile attire‚Ä¶ I had to bear it for what looked like an eternity but it subsided on its own‚Ä¶ ü•π

                        Itches have the worst timings. I mean, usually they would be non existent and the moment you
                        cannot possibly scratch, they suddenly manifest.

                        I was a lifeguard for a few months at a small pool in the south of England.

                        Often I was responsible for closing the pool up after the evening private swimming groups, and
                        sometimes my gf would meet me and we had some time in our own private pool.

                        One night she turned up with her cousin, and said she wanted to swim too. I pointed out that we
                        swam naked, she was ok with that but had a single piece costume herself.

                        In the water my gf starts to get romantic, I pointed out her cousin at the other end of the
                        pool, she says her cousin wants to watch us.

                        Long story short, we put one of the big foam floats on the pool side and gave her a good show,
                        which she visibly enjoyed.
